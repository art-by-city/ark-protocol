# Ark Protocol Hackathon

Ark is a multi-chain identity linking protocol. It allows users to associate their Arweave address with addresses on another chain, making it possible, for example, for an Arweave dApp to have proof that an Arweave user holds a cryptopunk on Ethereum, voted on a DAO proposal on Optimism, or holds a given ENS name.

This is a 4-week hackathon focused on developing multichain dApps on Arweave using Ark Protocol.

We are looking for submissions which integrate Ark as a core identity layer to a new or existing dApp.

$12,000 in the prize pool (+ other bonuses)

## What's been built on Ark

**ar.page**

A social explorer for holders of ANS (Arweave Name Service) domains. Linked with Ark, it shows cross-chain NFTs and activity from EVM chains for Arweave users.

**POAP -> Arweave airdrop bridge**

An app built to bridge POAP ownership to Arweave users. For example: a user scans a QR code for a POAP at an event; the POAP is an access ticket to an airdrop on Arweave; the user connects their xDAI (EVM, 0x) wallet to Ark protocol and can claim their airdrop.
